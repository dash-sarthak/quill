            <p>I envy the dead.</p>
            <p>The sunlight poured into you from the huge open windows, shame lost to something less nuanced, something more primal. The rickety, almost decaying oak of the the table-top held you like it’s own - perhaps that’s where you belonged, a leaf
                in a labyrinth of vines, a page, slightly yellowed in the corners in some lost adventurer’s journal as he frantically poured his dying, black ink onto you. Around you lay the remnants of a night scribbled onto crumpled pieces of paper
                with words deemed unworthy, or maybe too blunt.</p>
            <p>Did you get any sleep?</p>
            <p>I found disdain in your eyes, eyes that seemed too tired to express. Perhaps it was pity, for I did not understand the stakes of your words, or the beauty of the worlds they resided in. I would have felt pity for me too.</p>
            <p>I envy them, for the inconsequentialities of their being. No mistakes to learn from, no fire ever too hot to touch, no height too high. The dead live without fear, for isn’t death what we all set out to achieve?</p>
